This website provides a Mastermind game in form of a Python console game. It is presented in a mock terminal in the browser.

Mastermind is a classic game where the objective is to guess a secret code consisting of a specific number of colors. The colors are represented by numbers in this game. After each guess the user receives feedback. They take the feedback into account to make a new guess until the code is cracked or a maximum number of attempts is reached. Three distinct difficulty levels are available in this game.

## User Experience - UX

### Target Audience

This game is designed for anyone who wishes to play a single player game that requires some analytical thinking and problem solving skills. Due to the different difficulty levels the game is suitable to beginners as well as advanced mastermind players. Because it is a console game, most likely it will appeal more to people who are more used to working on computers. Also the site is not well suited for mobile devices and users will most likely acces it from a laptop or desktop.

### User Stories

- As a user, I would like to play a game of mastermind that is functional and easy to control.
- As a user, I would like to choose a difficulty level.
- As a user, I would like to get clear information on the secret code specifications.
- As a user, I would like to receive clear feedback in case a guess is not valid.
- As a user, I would like to receive clear feedback on how close my guess is to the secret code.
- As a user, I would like to clearly see when I have lost a game.
- As a user, I would like to clearly see when I won a game.
- As a user, I would like to be able to exit the game when I want to.
- As a user, I would like to avoid to accidentally quit the game.
- As a user, I would like to be able to access game instructions.

- As a user with visual impairments, I would like to be able to select a plain text mode to bypass any visual elements.

### Colour Scheme

I used the [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) module to add font color to the application. I used the following colors:

- Blue for the logo and to highlight the word Mastermind
- Cyan to highlight important information
- Red for error messages, the last round warning and the lose message
- Green, Yellow and Red to indicate the levels Easy, Classic and Hard respectively
- Magenta for subheadings in the instructions page
- Green for hits and yellow for close on the board
- Blue, cyan, red, green, yellow, magenta for the code guesses and secret code


## Features

### Existing Features

| Feature | Description | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Start Screen** | Upon page load a start screen with only plain text is displayed. The user has the option to select whether to start the application in plain text mode or not. Plain text mode means that all visual elements, like Ascii art or formatted tables are avoided. This is most important for screen readers.  | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-start-screen.png) |
| **Plain Text Mode** | When plain text mode is selected, all visual elements will be avoided throughout the application. A confirmation that this mode was selected is displayed on the screen and the user can press ENTER to continue to the game. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-plain-text-mode-selected.png) |
| **Logo** | The logo appears on top of the terminal and uses an Ascii art font from the [pyfiglet](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/) module. The goal is to prominently display the game name. It has a clean and futuristic look which fits with the game of this logic terminal game.  | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-logo.png) |
| **Plain Text Logo** | In plain text mode the logo is just 'MASTERMIND' in bright blue font.  | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-logo-plain.png) |
| **Game Menu** | After the viewing mode is selected a game menu is displayed, where the user can choose between three options, 'Play Game', 'Show Instructions' or 'Exit'.  | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-game-menu.png) |
| **Instructions** | When the user selects option 2 in the game menu game instructions are displayed and can be closed again by pressing ENTER. If the user presses ENTER the game menu will be displayed again. The instructions describe the game and give details about the objective, rules, levels, feedback, winning, tips and how to exit the game.  | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-instructions-1.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-instructions-2.png) |
| **Exit** | When the user selects option 3 in the game menu an exit confirmation is displayed before the console is cleared and a good bye message is shown. The application is terminated. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-menu-exit-message.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-good-bye-message.png)  |
| **Level Menu** | When the user selects option 1 in the game menu another menu, the level menu is displayed. There are three distinct difficulty level options to choose from. Level 1 or Easy, level 2 or Classic and level 3 or Hard. Once the user chooses a level, a confirmation is shown before the respective game starts.  | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-level-menu.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-level-menu-choice-confirmation.png) |
| **Level Introduction** | When the user selects a level in the level menu, a page with details about the selected level is displayed. The user can continue to the game by pressing ENTER. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-level-intro-easy.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-level-intro-classic.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-level-intro-hard.png) |
| **Main Game Page** | Add description | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-main-game-page.png) |
| **Plain Text Main Game Page** | Add description  | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-main-game-page-plain.png) |
| **Secret Code description** | Now the main game starts. On top of the page, just below the logo, a description of the secret code is provided. This is for the users convenience so they do not have to memorize the specifications of the code for their chosen level. The secret code consists of a number of colors, which are here represented by numbers. The description states how many digits are in the code and what the minimum and maximum values allowed are. It also states whether color repetitions are allowed or not and how many rounds one has to crack the code. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-code-description-easy.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-code-description-classic.png)![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-code-description-hard.png) |
| **Round Display** | Below the code description the current round is displayed. | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-round-display.png) |
| **Guess Input** | add description | ![screenshot](documentation/features/feature-guess-input.png) |

### Future Features

- A useful future feature would be for the user to be able to quit a game without having to quit the entire application. They could open the menu, choose another level for example and start another game.
- It would also be interesting to add the option to show and hide instructions throughout playing without quitting the game.

## Data Model

### Flowchart

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created for the app's logic,
and mapped out before coding began using a free version of
[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) and/or [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io).

Below is the flowchart of the main process of this Python program. It shows the entire cycle of the program.

![screenshot](documentation/flowchart.png)

### Classes & Functions

The program uses classes as a blueprint for the project's objects (OOP). This allows for the object to be reusable.

```python
class Person:
    """ Insert docstring comments here """
    def __init__(self, name, age, health, inventory):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.health = health
        self.inventory = inventory
```

The primary functions used on this application are:

- `get_sales_data()`
    - Get sales figures input from the user.
- `validate_data()`
    - Converts all string values into integers.
- `update_worksheet()`
    - Update the relevant worksheet with the data provided.
- `calculate_surplus_data()`
    - Compare sales with stock and calculate the surplus for each item type.
- `get_last_5_entries_sales()`
    - Collects columns of data from sales worksheet.
- `calculate_stock_data()`
    -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%.
- `main()`
    - Run all program functions.

### Imports

I've used the following Python packages and/or external imported packages.

- `gspread`: used with the Google Sheets API
- `google.oauth2.service_account`: used for the Google Sheets API credentials
- `time`: used for adding time delays
- `os`: used for adding a `clear()` function
- `colorama`: used for including color in the terminal
- `random`: used to get a random choice from a list

## Testing

> [!NOTE]  
> For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser.
This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://mastermind-python-game-abfdb9163a4b.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- If using any confidential credentials, such as CREDS.JSON, then these should be pasted in the Config Variables as well.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If using any confidential credentials, such as `CREDS.json` or `env.py` data, these will need to be manually added to your own newly created project as well.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/theresaabl/mastermind) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/theresaabl/mastermind.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/theresaabl/mastermind)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/theresaabl/mastermind)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
